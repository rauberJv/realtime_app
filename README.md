# Realtime App

## 📌 Overview

Realtime App is a web application that provides real-time website metrics using a **Vite + Preact** frontend and a web service backend. The frontend consumes API data and displays real-time analytics.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Real-time website metrics visualization
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight frontend built with **Vite + Preact**
- 🔌 WebSocket or polling-based real-time data updates
- 📡 REST API backend integration

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
realtime_app/
│── backend/      # Backend web service (API & WebSocket server)
│── frontend/     # Frontend application (Vite + Preact)
│── README.md     # Project documentation
```

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rauberJv/realtime_app.git
cd realtime_app
```

### 2️⃣ Setup & Run Backend

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```sh
cd backend
npm install  # or yarn install
```

Start the backend server:

```sh
npm run dev  # or yarn dev
```

### 3️⃣ Setup & Run Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

```sh
cd ../frontend
npm install  # or yarn install
```

Start the frontend app:

```sh
npm run dev  # or yarn dev
```

By default, the frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173` and the backend on `http://localhost:3000` (configurable in environment variables).

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Open the frontend app in a browser.
2. Connect to the backend API to fetch real-time website metrics.
3. Monitor metrics in real time with dynamic updates.

## 🔧 Configuration

You can configure environment variables for both frontend and backend in `.env` files.

**Example for Backend (**``**):**

```
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/realtime_db
```

**Example for Frontend (**``**):**

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔮 Future Work

### Frontend Enhancements

- Expand data visualization by integrating additional chart types.
- Optimize data processing and structure for improved performance and scalability.
- Develop advanced analytical functions to extract deeper insights from real-time data.
- Implement a customizable dashboard to allow users to tailor metrics to their needs.
- Explore caching strategies to reduce API load and improve responsiveness.

### Backend Improvements

- Refactor and enhance data structure to adopt a more scalable and maintainable architecture.
- Improve API performance by implementing indexing and query optimizations.
- Introduce a **time-series database** to efficiently manage and query real-time data.
- Implement a hybrid storage solution, utilizing a time-series database for real-time data and a relational or NoSQL database for long-term storage.
- Enhance API flexibility to support dynamic data queries and filtering.
- Improve security and authentication to ensure data integrity and controlled access.
